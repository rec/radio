2. Installation
---------------


As of version 0.3.0, ezstream no longer comes with an installer. If you have a
previous version of ezstream installed, you might want to simply uninstall it.

The ezstream.exe file can be run from any location. To install it, simply copy
it to a location of your choosing. To make it available anywhere on the
system, add the installation folder to your PATH environment variable.

If it doesn't start, e.g. running
  > ezstream.exe -h
does not show the command line help, the Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 runtime
libraries are missing. Download and install vcredist_x86.exe, which can be
easily found on www.microsoft.com via
  http://www.google.com/search?q=vc+2008+redist



3. Limited functionality
------------------------


A few useful features are missing in the Windows version of ezstream:
 * Runtime control via signals is not possible.
 * Some useful external utilities (encoders, decoders) may not be available on
   Windows.
