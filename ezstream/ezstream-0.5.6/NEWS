Changes in 0.5.6, released on 2009-08-31:

 * ezstream-file.sh:
   - [NEW]   Add and install ezstream-file.sh, a new convenience shell script
             that generates configuration and playlist from a template and
             command line, respectively. (Bourne shell and POSIX utilities
             required.)
             See ezstream-file.sh(1) for details.
 * src/ezstream.c:
   - [MISC]  Be more tolerant towards faulty playlists and similar issues.
             Failure to open a resource (e.g. a media file) is no longer fatal
             and operation will continue until 100 subsequent errors. Based on
             an idea from dhorton.
             (Ticket #1585)
   - [NEW]   New command line option -s: Make ezstream function as a line-
             based shuffling utility.
 * src/playlist.c:
   - [MISC]  Consider no output from a playlist program to be equivalent to an
             empty line, indicating that the end of the playlist is reached.
   - [FIX]   Do not complain when receiving an empty line from a playlist
             program.
 * examples/:
   - [NEW]   Add a real-world example playlist script with logging feature.


Changes in 0.5.5, released on 2009-08-01:

 * win32/config.h:
   - [FIX]   Re-enable TagLib support in MSVC build. Found by Roman Donchenko.
             (Ticket #1535)

 * various:
   - [NEW]   New optional <sourceuser/> configuration option, to change the
             username used in authentication with Icecast. Suggested by
             Akos Veres.
   - [MISC]  Further improvements and minor fixes in the build system.



Changes in 0.5.4, released on 2009-03-28:

 * compat/sys/tree.*:
   - [MISC]  Update the tree macros to a newer version. The manual, shipped for
             reference, now has a more friendly 2-clause BSD license.

 * various:
   - [FIX]   Add a missing metadata charset conversion, and add charset
             conversions for filenames. From Roman Donchenko.
   - [FIX]   Fix build on MinGW. From Roman Donchenko.
   - [MISC]  Overhaul and modernize the build system. Ezstream is now expected
             to build "out of the box" on more systems without configuration
             tweaks.
   - [FIX]   Adjust the build system to better handle optional dependencies.
             It is now possible to choose between TagLib and libvorbis for
             reading Ogg Vorbis metadata, or no Vorbis metadata support at
             all. (Ticket #1398)
   - [MISC]  Miscellaneous code maintenance and a bit of cleaning up.



Changes in 0.5.3, released on 2007-12-01:

 * src/ezstream.c:
   - [FIX]   Prevent (very) long-running ezstream processes from dying without
             error message by ignoring SIGPIPE where available.



Changes in 0.5.2, released on 2007-11-04:

 * src/ezstream.c:
   - [FIX]   Fix a crash that occurs when streaming from standard input without
             using a script or program that supplies metadata information.
             (Ticket #1247)
   - [FIX]   Similar to the fix for #1247, properly initialize another
             variable. The result is a cosmetic fix for the "real-time" status
             line when streaming from standard input.
   - [MISC]  Provide a useful error message when there's no more data to read
             from standard input instead of talking about scary, bad file
             descriptors.
   - [MISC]  Further prettify the output to make more sense when streaming from
             standard input.

 * src/xalloc.c:
   - [FIX]   A rare, possible crash has been fixed in an error path.

 * examples/*:
   - [NEW]   Add an example configuration for streaming from standard input.
   - [MISC]  Improve reencoding examples to make them more easily usable with
             fewer changes.
   - [MISC]  Reenconding example files have been renamed.



Changes in 0.5.1, released on 2007-09-16:

 * src/playlist.c:
   - [FIX]   Fix a segmentation fault in playlist_*_next() when trying to
             access empty playlists. (Ticket #1240)

 * src/ezstream.c:
   - [MISC]  Issue a warning in verbose mode when dealing with an empty
             playlist file. This also makes it more obvious what is going on
             when a user makes ezstream spin on an empty playlist with
             <stream_once/> set to 0.



Changes in 0.5.0, released on 2007-08-31:

 * src/ezstream.c:
   - [FIX]   The special case of streaming MP3 files without reencoding had
             been lost, causing such streams to have no metadata. This has
             been fixed. (Ticket #1225)
   - [MISC]  Handle SIGINT and SIGTERM to perform a clean shutdown.

 * various:
   - [NEW]   A new convenience feature has been added, to allow automatic
             normalization of metadata strings. Useful if the majority of
             files come from a broken encoder/tagging program. Disabled
             by default, this feature can be enabled with the new `-n'
             command line parameter.
   - [NEW]   Enable Unicode support in TagLib and convert metadata strings
             to the current locale (LC_CTYPE) before displaying them on the
             console. Unsupported characters are displayed as '?', which
             does not affect the actual metadata. This feature requires
             iconv() via libc, if available, or GNU libiconv.
   - [NEW]   Support gettimeofday() functionality on all platforms, including
             Windows. The "real-time status line" when using the -q and -v
             parameters is now complete everywhere.
   - [MISC]  Add new --enable-debug configuration option to the configure
             script, which enables (also new) memory debugging features.
             (Not interesting for non-developers.)
   - [MISC]  Various small code cleanups.

 * The Windows build of ezstream now supports reading metadata from files
   with TagLib.



Changes in 0.4.3, released on 2007-07-24:

 * src/ezstream.c:
   - [FIX]   Plug the file descriptor leak, partially fixed in version 0.4.1,
             for good - it affected more than just the -q use case.



Changes in 0.4.2, released on 2007-07-17:

 * src/ezstream.c:
   - [FIX]   Make <stream_once/> work with playlists, too. Problem found by
             Geoff Shang <geoff at quitelikely dot com>.



Changes in 0.4.1, released on 2007-07-15:

 * src/ezstream.c:
   - [FIX]   Plug a file descriptor leak when using the -q parameter.

 * Documentation:
   - [FIX]   Minor spelling/consistency fixes.



Changes in 0.4.0, released on 2007-03-11:

 * src/util.*:
   - [FIX]   The xfree() function did not work as intended due to a programming
             error. Found, and fix suggested, by Karl Heyes.

 * src/playlist.*:
   - [FIX]   An error compareable to the one about xfree() in src/util.* has
             been fixed.
   - [MISC]  Refuse to execute a group- or world-writeable playlist script or
             program.

 * src/compat.c:
   - [ADD]   Implement a basename() function for Windows that behaves like the
             ones used on Unix systems.

 * win32/:
   - [MISC]  Remove the rather ugly HTML version of the man page from the
             distribution, and provide a much better PDF version instead.

 * various:
   - [ADD]   Allow ezstream to use TagLib for reading metadata from media
             files. TagLib (libtag_c) is now an optional dependency.
   - [ADD]   When built with TagLib support, include the song length in the
             "real-time" information line, if available.
   - [ADD]   New <metadata_progname> configuration option, which causes
             metadata to be read from the output of an external program or
             script.
   - [ADD]   New runtime control via the SIGUSR2 signal, which triggers reading
             of fresh metadata information from <metadata_progname> (metadata
             is always read at song changes.)
   - [ADD]   New <metadata_format> configuration option, to customize metadata
             strings when used with the new <metadata_progname> feature.
   - [ADD]   New '@a@' and '@t@' placeholders for separate artist and title
             metadata in de-/encoder commands.



Changes in 0.3.0, released on 2007-03-05:

 * The original author, Ed Zaleski, hands over ezstream maintainership to
   Moritz Grimm.

 * New features:
   - Playlist shuffling support, enabled via the new <shuffle> configuration
     option.
   - Playlist scripting support: Indicate that the executable in <filename>
     should be run each time to get a new media filename to stream, by setting
     the new <playlist_program> configuration option to 1.
   - New <stream_once> configuration option, which makes ezstream play a media
     file or playlist once and then exit.
   - New <reconnect_tries> option to restrict the number of reconnection
     attempts to a server in case the connection goes down.
   - Add feature to skip the currently streaming track, done by sending the
     SIGUSR1 signal to the ezstream process.
   - New command line option `-q': Suppress standard error output from external
     de-/encoders.
   - New command line option `-v': Produce more verbose output.
   - New "real-time" status display of the stream when both -q and -v are given
     on the command line.
   - Thorough configuration file checks with helpful error messages.
   - The @M@ metadata placeholder is now supported in <decode>.
   - Playlists may now have the '.txt' filename extension in addition to
     '.m3u'.

 * Fixes:
   - At least one stack and one heap overflow have been fixed.
   - Several memory leaks have been fixed.
   - Strict checking of the configuration file prevents unexpected behavior and
     adds another safeguard to prevent crashes.
   - Fixed and more portable signal handling.

 * Miscellaneous, user-visible changes:
   - Improved documentation. Ezstream now has a comprehensive man page and the
     README file has been rewritten.
   - Consistency improvements in the configuration examples. The examples are
     now also installed.
   - The <format/> and <match/> configuration elements, as well as filename
     extension matching to detect playlists in the <filename> element, are
     now case insensitive.
   - Various improvements in the build system and portability fixes.
   - Consistent and more helpful messages from ezstream. By default, ezstream
     no longer clutters the screen with lots of output (some information that
     used to be available needs to be enabled with the new `-v' command line
     parameter.)
   - Tweaked metadata string generation: no more lone " - " dashes at the
     beginning or end of the string.
   - New command line option `-V': Print the version number and exit.



Changes in 0.2.1, released on 2005-12-14:

 * src/ezstream.c:
   - [FIX]   Prevent a heap overflow with large ID3v1 tags.
   - [FIX]   Use pclose() on FILE* handles that were opened with popen().



Changes in 0.2.0, released on 2005-01-05:

   - [MISC]  Clean up and improve example configuration files, and add more
             examples.

 * src/ezstream.c:
   - [FIX]   Fix reencoding support on Windows.
   - [ADD]   Attempt to reconnect to a server if the connection goes down
             during streaming.

   - [ADD]   Support passing through unknown media types.



Changes in 0.1.2, released on 2004-04-21:

 * src/ezstream.c:
   - [ADD]   Add feature to reread the playlist after the currently streaming
             track, done by sending the SIGHUP signal to the ezstream process.



Changes is 0.1.1, released on 2004-02-02:

 * src/ezstream.c:
   - [FIX]   Set read mode to binary for stdin on WIN32.

 * win32/ezstream.dsp:
